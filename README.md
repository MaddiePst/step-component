# Component Interaction & State Management in React

This project is a hands-on React page designed to reinforce core concepts in modern front-end development. It focuses on handling events, managing state, rendering conditionally, and creating reusable components with `children` props.

## 📝 Overview

This is a simple yet powerful React component showcasing:

- Event-driven UI updates
- Dynamic rendering based on application state
- Modular, reusable components
- Clear separation of logic and presentation

It serves as a learning playground for essential React features and a reference for future projects.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Handle user interactions via **event listeners**
- Use `useState` to track and update component state
- Implement **conditional rendering** to display content dynamically
- Reuse components via the **`children` prop**
- Update state based on its **current value** (functional updates)
- Apply **React Hooks** for clean and efficient logic

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me understand and practice the following:

1. **Handling Events** – I learned to manage user inputs and actions using `onClick`, `onChange`, and other DOM events.
2. **Working with State** – Using the `useState` hook to store and update dynamic data in functional components.
3. **Conditional Rendering** – Displaying different UI elements based on application state with logical and ternary expressions.
4. **Using Hooks** – Gained practical experience with `useState` and functional updates.
5. **Updating State Based on Current State** – Ensured state updates are accurate using callback functions inside `setState`.
6. **The `children` Prop** – Increased component reusability by rendering nested elements passed from parent components.
