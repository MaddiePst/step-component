### 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me solidify essential React concepts:

1. **Handling Events** – Responding to button clicks and updating UI accordingly.
2. **State Management** – Using `useState` to track and update the current step.
3. **Conditional Rendering** – Showing/hiding elements based on state.
4. **Working with Hooks** – Leveraging the `useState` hook to manage dynamic behavior.
5. **Updating State Based on Previous State** – Using functional updates to ensure accurate state transitions.
6. **The `children` Prop** – Building reusable, flexible components that can accept dynamic content.
